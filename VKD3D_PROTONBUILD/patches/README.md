# dxvk-tools userpatches


You can make use of your own patches to vkd3d-proton by putting them in this folder before running upvkd3d-proton

They need to be diffs against the vkd3d-proton tree.


You need to give your patch the appropriate extension :

**!! Patches with unrecognized extension will get ignored !!**

- You can use your own vkd3d patches by giving them the .vkd3dpatch extension.
- You can also revert vkd3d patches by giving them the .vkd3drevert extension.
